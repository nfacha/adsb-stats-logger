# ADS-B Stats Logger
## Like this project? Don't forget to STAR it and follow it for future releases :)

## Features

- Log all unique flights seen by the ADS-B receiver
- Log all unique operators seen by the ADS-B receiver
- Log the flight with the highest altitude seen by the ADS-B receiver
- Log the flight with the highest speed seen by the ADS-B receiver
- Log the flight the furthest away from the ADS-B receiver
- Log the flight closest from the ADS-B receiver
- Log the flight with the best signal strength seen by the ADS-B receiver
- Log the flight with the worst signal strength seen by the ADS-B receiver
- All data is available in Metric Units (by default) or Imperial Units

## Python Compatibility
This has been tested and confirmed to work on Python 3.10, but should work fine in Python.

## Usage
1. Clone the git repo on your ADS-B server and enter its directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nfacha/adsb-stats-logger.git
cd adsb-stats-logger
```
2. Copy the config file sample:
```bash
cp config.ini.sample config.ini
```
3. Edit the config to your liking, one easy way would be using nano
```bash
nano config.ini
```
4. Edit the config to your liking, one easy way would be using nano
```ini
[PATHS]
DATA_PATH = /run/dump1090-fa/ #The path to your dump1090 logs folder
[LOCATION]
STATION_LAT = 37.7 #Your base station latitude, used for distance calculations
STATION_LNG = 37.7 #Your base station longitude, used for distance calculations
[LOGGING]
SENTRY_DSN =#Sentry DSN for error logging, leave empry to disable
SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=#Sentry environment, leave empry to disable
LOG_LEVEL = 20 #Log level, see https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels
[UNITS]
USE_METRIC_SYSTEM = true #Use metric system for distance calculations, else use caveman units (a.k.a. imperial)
```
5. Leave the script running in the background, one easy way would be to use screen
```bash
screen -S logger -dm python3 logger.py
```
6. By now the script should be running, wait a bit for data to gather and as soon as you have at least one plane in your range it should start to gather data, to see this data use
```bash
python3 show.py
```
You will get an output similar to this:

```

```bash
screen -x logger
```
